# Netmiko
This is my work in progress to bring network automation to a network and use a known good

To be able to use these scripts you first must install netmiko - Use the following commands on your linux box
  - get-install update
  - get-install upgrade
  - get-install python3
  - get-install python3-pip
  - pip3 install netmiko

Things to do
  1. Record hostname to name files
  2. Backup to external share drive
  3. Parse through data to see if the config already has the commands in
  4. Automatic times script runs (weekly)
